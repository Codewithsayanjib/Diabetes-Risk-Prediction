# ü©∫ Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning  

This project applies various machine learning models to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on medical diagnostic measurements.  
It uses the **PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset** (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) and evaluates multiple models with preprocessing, feature scaling, and visualization techniques.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Steps Performed  

### 1. Data Preprocessing  
- Checked for **missing values**  
- Imputed missing values using **median** strategy  
- Handled outliers  
- Applied **StandardScaler** to normalize features  

### 2. Model Training  
Trained and evaluated the following models individually:  
- Logistic Regression  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- XGBoost  

### 3. Model Evaluation  
- **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score**  
- **Confusion Matrix**  
- **ROC‚ÄìAUC Curve for all models**  

### 4. Visualizations  
- Correlation heatmap of features  
- Feature distributions (histograms, boxplots)  
- ROC‚ÄìAUC curves for model comparison
